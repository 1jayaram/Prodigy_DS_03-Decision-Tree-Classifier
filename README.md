# Prodigy_DS_03-Decision-Tree-Classifier

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioural data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Task 3 enriched my expertise in building decision tree classifiers for predictive modelling tasks and understanding how demographic and behavioural data influence customer purchasing decisions.
